                    Cats conserve energy by sleeping for an average of 13 to 14 hours a day. Cats have flexible bodies and teeth adapted for
                    hunting small animals such as mice and rats. A group of cats is called a clowder, a male cat is called a tom, a female
                    cat is called a molly or queen while young cats are called kittens.

                    <p>Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness. Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision
                    and night vision are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18 toes (five toes on each front paw;
                    four toes on each back paw). Cats can jump up to six times their length.
